								<h2>More about the title</h2>
								<p>The title is a play on the mathematical concept of a derivative from calculus. 
									A first derivative of any continuous function, say f(x), can be represented by f’(x). 
									f’(x) gives us the slope of the tangent of function f(x) at x.<br> 
									The first derivative is often taken with respect to time and that tells us the rate at 
									which the function is changing. For example, if s(t) is a function that represents 
									the speed of a car for any time t the first derivative of this function, s’(t) will be the 
									acceleration of the car. The first derivative will tell us how fast the speed of the car 
									is changing. <br>
								</p>
								<p>For this project I wanted to focus on influences of information exchange on cultural and 
									societal change. This posed a problem as all cultures change over time even without influences 
									of technology, if we analyse the rate of this change or the first derivative of societal change 
									we can get a much better picture of the influences of information technology. To quantify this 
									change I have chose to use <em>memes</em> the way they were originally defined by Richard Dawkins. </p>
