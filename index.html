											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
										The complexity of culture can be encompassed by the numerous variations in knowledge, beliefs, art, morals, laws, customs and even habits that an individual adopts by just being a part of a society(Taylor, 36). Culture is dynamic. Therefore, it is always changing and evolving. The exchange of information and ideas has allowed many cultures to disseminate globally. This very exchange is the essence of how culture evolves. The rate of information exchange is heavily dependent on two primary factors: How far and how fast the information can travel. These rates  have had an upward trend throughout history as new media evolve. Currently, we are at a point where information can travel millions of miles and to millions of people faster than the blink of an eye. In the following article, I hope to explore the correlation between the rate of societal change and the rapidity with which information can be exchanged. Currently, the processes by which information is accessed and distributed are automated, I think it would be interesting to explore what happens when the generation of information is automated.

						<!--First Question-->
						<section id="Question1" class="main">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>How can the rate of culture change be quantified ?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>This question poses a logistical challenge. Cultural change, while clearly observable, is extremely difficult to quantify and measure. To address this, I will be using the concept of a “<em>memes</em>” as defined by Richard Dawkins.<br> 
							A <em>memes</em> is a gene analog and can be considered a single unit that replicates and propagates in the brains of people. “<em>memes</em> are complex units, distinct and memorable--units with staying power” (Gleick, Ch 11). A <em>memes</em> unit is an elemental snapshot of culture, it could be an idea, an image or even a catchphrase. Therefore, <em>memes</em> can be a good indicator of culture change, the rate at which new <em>memes</em> are produced and old <em>memes</em> forgotten, can help us measure the abstract concept of cultural change.</p>
							<p>Cultural change is a constant, even without any improvements to the information exchange speed or reach, <em>memes</em> keep on replicating and mutating. However, the rate of this change is dependent on the means of information exchange. In the Hard Times by Charles Dickens we catch a glimpse of what the speed of information exchange was in the 19th Century.  Britain was in the midst of a period of rapid technological growth. Long range communication had just become possible through telegraphs. Even though the telegraphs were not actively used in the story their presence indicated a general upward trend in communication systems.</p> 
							<p>Mrs. Sparsit, was officially Mr. Bounderby’s housekeeper but longed to be his companion and confidant. After Mr. Bounderby’s marriage to Louisa, Mrs Sparsit wanted to disparage Louisa and tried to catch Lousia having an affair with Mr. Harthouse. Through her journey to indict Louisa, we can see instances where information exchange is often asymmetrical. One notable instance was when Mrs. Sparsit eavesdropped on Lousia and Mr. Harthouse and heard Mr. Harthouse profess his love. A <em>memes</em> of Lousia’s infidelity was created in her mind. The only way for this <em>memes</em> to replicate and spread was through slow physical communication. Mrs. Sparsit learns that Lousia is at her father’s house only when she and Mr. Bounderby meet her father, Mr. Gradgrind at the Stone Lodge.</p> 
							<p>The speed at which the <em>memes</em> of Louisa’s infidelity could replicate had a direct impact on the outcome of Mr. Harthouse’s proposal to Louisa. If Mrs. Sparsit had access to instant messaging services, this <em>memes</em> could have replicated and mutated in the minds of hundreds of people by the time Louisa could get back to her father. With access to Twitter, the <em>memes</em> could have reached the minds of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
							<p> Interestingly, Mrs. Sparsit did have a way to send this <em>memes</em> to thousands of people. Even though Dickens never explicitly mentions newspapers in the story, there were several daily publications in early 19th century Britain. The technology for information to reach mass populations did exist for the extremely wealthy. The current advancements in information technology have extended this ability of mass reach to anyone with a smartphone. Using the production rate of <em>memes</em> as a measure of the rate of change of culture, this comparison shows how the increase in information reach has increased the rate of culture change. </p>
							<p>Information exchange when done on a mass scale, however, can never be truly direct and democratized, physical limitations always exist. The newspapers were limited to the amount of text they could fit on physical paper. The virtual social media feeds and timelines can theoretically be scrolled forever, but even they are limited by the amount of information human brains can consume in finite time. Newspapers solve this problem with editorial staff that moderates what gets printed. Social media and online information feeds simply have too much information for humans to effectively moderate, instead they rely on automated systems. </p>
								

							
						</section>

						<!--Second Question-->
						<section id="Question2" class="main">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>What are the effects of automating the moderation?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The replacement of human editorial staff with automated systems has some interesting and unintended consequences. The systems behind content delivery on online news and social media feeds are not very different from a human editor at their core. They both try to serve relevant and engaging content from an almost infinite supply. Most of these content delivery systems are run by “black box” algorithms, algorithms which are not programmed to pick which kinds of information to serve but instead given a set of goals like ‘engagement’ and ‘watch time’ to maximise, same as the human editors. The automated systems are just much faster and better at optimizing individual feeds.</p> 
							<p>The unintended consequence of this optimization is that it exploits the vulnerabilities in human psychology. Human brains are riddled with biases and residual thought patterns that once might have provided an evolutionary benefit and even random patterns that simply did not impede evolutionary selection. A common bias that all humans are susceptible to is the “confirmation bias” (Nickerson, 176), a bias that makes new information more favourable if it supports a pre-existing belief and a rejection of opposing information.  The automated systems exploit this vulnerability by only pushing stories and information that agree with an already held belief. This strategy maximises user engagement time but has the unintended consequence of creating “echo chambers”. The “echo chambers”  thus created are virtual boundaries online that restrict the free movement of information and <em>memes</em> between communities with differing ideals.</p> 
							<p>The creation of these virtual chambers has a recursive effect on culture. Memes much like their genetic analog, do not care much about the hosts as long as they can survive. A <em>memes</em> that originates in a chamber opposing the majority view will have a quick death and one that supports the majority will thrive. Any ideas or <em>memes</em> that get in through the virtual filter have to survive the selective pressures created by the majority view of the chamber. </p>
							<p>Analyzing the rate of culture change using our metric of the <em>memes</em> yields some very interesting results. The <em>memes</em> are now created at a much faster rate due to near instantaneous communication of information, however, the reach of the <em>memes</em> is severely limited. The reach is no longer determined by geography but by ideology. The culture is changing at a faster rate but it is fragmented.</p>

						<!--Third Question-->
						<section id="Question3" class="main">
							<header class="major">
								<h2> How will automated information generation factor into this system of automated information distribution?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>A factor that has remained constant in my discussion of information technology through time has been the production of  information. Sure, automated systems create metadata and information about the content they serve but original creative ideas and <em>memes</em> still originate only in the minds of humans. While there may be a litany of philosophical arguments that argue that creativity and unique ideas are uniquely human, functionally that distinction might not matter. </p>
							<p>At the time of writing this article, we have created artificial intelligence systems like GPT-3(Brown, 13) by open AI that are in beta test stages. GPT-3 can effectively generate meaningful and coherent text that can use context to output unique phrases. The distinction that ideas are inherently human might not be relevant because language models like GPT-3 just need to be good enough to make economic sense. </p>
							<p>Our current capitalist economic systems incentivise profits over everything else. If a copywriter’s job can be done with eighty percent effectiveness by the algorithm with no labour costs, the economic incentives mandate that most copywriters will be replaced by automated language models. In that case, we will start to see <em>memes</em> created by computer systems in the wild. This will be a fundamental change in the current dynamic because <em>memes</em> live and replicate in the minds of people and once created they take a life of their own and the <em>memes</em> that might one day exist in our heads might not be human at all.</p>

							<header class="major">
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The rate of cultural change had taken interesting directions with the advancements of information technology. At the surface level there seems to be a direct correlation between the rate of cultural change and the speed and reach of information. However, this direct relationship gets more nuanced with modern automated information distribution systems where the information can be transferred instantaneously but the reach of information is impeded by virtual boundaries of echo chambers. I do not know what will happen to the rate of cultural change once the information generation is also automated. One possibility is that the rate will increase simply because machines can create <em>memes</em> at a much faster rate than humans, but even this can and most likely will have unintended consequences like the virtual boundaries created by automated information distribution systems.
