											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Culture encompasses the complex components of knowledge, beliefs, art, 
										morals, laws, customs and even habits acquired by people by just being a part of society.
										<sup><a href="#Taylor">1</a></sup> Culture is dynamic, it is always changing and evolving. 
										Information and exchange of ideas causes cultures to widen their reach and this very exchange
										of ideas is what allows cultures to change. The rate of information exchange depends mainly 
										on how far information travels and how fast information travels, and both of these attributes 
										have had an upward trend throughout history. We are at a point where information can travel
										millions of miles and to millions of people before the blink of an eye. <br> With this article I
										want to primarily explore the rate of societal change that we are experiencing due to the
										speed and reach of information exchange. Currently the processes by which information is accessed 
										and distributed are automated, I want to explore some of the possibilities when 
										information generation also becomes automated.

						<!--First Question-->
						<section id="Question1" class="main">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>How can the rate of information change or culture change be quantified ?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>This poses a logistical challenge. Cultural change, while clearly observable,
								 is really difficult to quantify and measure. To deal with this I will be using the
								  concept of a “meme” as defined by Richard Dawkins. A meme is a gene analog and can 
								  be considered a single unit that replicates and propagates in the brains of people. 
								  “Memes are complex units, distinct and memorable--units with staying power”(Gleick, Ch 11).
								  A meme unit is an elemental snapshot of culture, it could be an idea, an image or even a 
								  catchphrase. Therefore, memes can be a good indicator of culture change, the rate at which 
								  new memes are produced and old memes forgotten, can help us measure the abstract concept of
								  cultural change. <br>
